The official place to look for these JSON schemas is now https://ld4p.github.io/sinopia.

We decided to serve them via github pages so it would be easiest for the devs to

    have clearly versioned schemas
    persist old versions of the schemas
    be able to add new versions with a minimum of dependency on ops
