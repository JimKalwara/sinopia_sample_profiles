# Sinopia Sample Profiles & Templates

This repository contains sample profiles and repository templates for use with the Library of Congress BIBFRAME Editor (and derived codebases). These are the specifications that guide input form generation in those editors, and maps the form field values to RDF statements (or vice versa).

Profiles generally are combinations of resource templates with some additional metadata included.
