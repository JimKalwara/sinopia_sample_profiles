This directory includes HRC profiles created for testing purposes

*Test no. 1*
Cloned and edited LC Admin Metadata collating profile using both the Sinopia Profile editor (SPE) and directly in Atom. The atom edited profile gives an error when trying ot upload to Sinopia LD editor ("ERROR - CANNOT USE PROFILE/RESOURCE TEMPLATE: problem parsing JSON template: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 	 in JSON at position 6458"). The SPE edited profile uploads wiht no problem, but Sinopia LD editor still doesn't load properties that include default values, and only allows to enter data on the first two properties. When trying to enter data in any of the other properties, it will automatically jump to the first two.
